These objects are often called elements or members of a set. For example, a group of players in a cricket team is a set. Since the number of players in a cricket team could be only 11 at a time, thus we can say, this set is a finite set. Another example of a finite set is a set of English vowels. But there are many sets that have infinite members such as a set of natural numbers, a set of whole numbers, set of real numbers, set of imaginary numbers, etc. ",
